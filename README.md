# Web-API-Book-Store
A simple Web API project with basic store functionality (browse, add to cart) and basic HTTP authentication

This project shows how to implement basic HTTP authentication with ASP.NET Web API. Authentication is implemented in a message handler that checks the incoming request. If the request contains a valid Authentication header, and if the credentials are valid, a ClaimsIdentity object is created.
